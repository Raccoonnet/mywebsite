        <h2>OH-ICEE</h2>
        <p>OH-ICEE is a friendly shop that specializes in pastries and boba drinks. When I visited I purchased a
          Thai boba drink and an OH-ICEE Strawberry Banana crepe.
          Both were excellent, but the crepe was truly unique. The crepe was massive and turned out to be an excellent
          sharable treat.</p>

        <h2>Pease's at Bunn Gourmet</h2>
        <p>Pease's is a classy pastry and coffee shop. I tried both the coffee and the pastries.
          Both were good, but I was most impressed with their pastry work. The pastries that I tried were very elegant.

        <h2>Grab-A-Java</h2>
        <p>Grab-A-Java is a local coffee chain in Springfield and sells excellent hand brewed coffee. I highly recommend
          their coffee and they have an excellent selection.
          Additionally, the staff was very friendly and accommodating. The only draw back is that their business is run
          from a drive through, and as such ordering is kind of slow.
          Still, it was the best local coffee that I had in Springfield.</p>

        <p>The Lincoln Tomb was a timeless destination. It is definitely a must see if one ever travels to Springfield.
          The destination pays homage to one of our greatest presidents and has many statues and plagues describing his
          great work. The location is also very peaceful.</p>

        <h2>Lincoln Memorial Garden and Nature Center</h2>
        <p>The Lincoln Memorial Garden and Nature Center is a wonderful location right near Lake Springfield to take in
          some nature and enjoy the Illinois outdoors.
          They have hiking and festivals sometimes. When I went, the fall festival was open and I had a good time
          listening to live music.</p>
