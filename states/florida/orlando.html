    <h1>Orlando, Florida: More Than Just Mouse Ears</h1>
    <p>It’s easy to let the theme parks define Orlando — and to be fair, they’re hard to ignore. But once you step beyond the gates, a different city unfolds. One built on small neighborhood cafés, indie art spaces, tropical gardens, and an unexpected culinary pulse that makes you stop mid-bite and say, <em>“Wait, this is Orlando?”</em></p>
    <p>This isn’t the Florida of postcards. It’s better — and more real.</p>
