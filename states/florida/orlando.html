  <h1>Orlando, Florida: More Than Just Mouse Ears</h1>
  <p>It’s easy to let the theme parks define Orlando — and to be fair, they’re hard to ignore. But once you step beyond
    the gates, a different city unfolds. One built on small neighborhood cafés, indie art spaces, tropical gardens, and
    an unexpected culinary pulse that makes you stop mid-bite and say, <em>“Wait, this is Orlando?”</em></p>
  <p>This isn’t the Florida of postcards. It’s better — and more real.</p>

  <h2>Cuisine: Global Bites, Local Soul</h2>
  <p>Orlando’s food scene has no patience for bland.
    It’s a patchwork of influences — Vietnamese bánh mì shops in Colonialtown, soul food staples in Parramore, Dominican
    cafes with strong cafecito, and downtown bistros with five-course tasting menus.
    But it’s not flashy. It’s flavorful, intentional, and always tied to the community.
    Farmers’ markets, food halls, and hidden gems in converted bungalows? Orlando is full of surprises — and most of
    them are edible.</p>

  <h2>Culture: Imaginative, Independent, and Proudly Offbeat</h2>
  <p>Orlando’s creativity isn’t confined to soundstages.
    You’ll find it in mural-covered alleyways, underground zines, immersive theater, and experimental music shows in
    converted warehouses.
    It’s a place where drag brunches draw sold-out crowds, and where you might stumble into a film screening in a
    sculpture garden.
    The city leans into its weirdness — in the best way — and backs it with serious talent and community support.</p>

<!-- Coffee Section -->
<section>
  <h2>Coffee: Quirky, Cozy, and Community-Fueled</h2>
  <p>Orlando’s coffee culture feels like a secret handshake — a way for locals to slow down and reconnect.
    Whether it’s a minimalist third-wave café serving Ethiopian pourovers or a cozy plant-filled corner spot
    with tarot readings on Sundays, coffee shops here aren’t just about caffeine. They’re about vibe.
    Expect rotating art shows, live vinyl sets, and baristas who know your name — or at least your order.</p>

  <h2>The Magic Outside the Parks</h2>
  <p>Orlando doesn’t try to compete with its theme park reputation.
    It just offers something different — a real city, full of flavor and surprise, where creative people live, work, and
    build community.
    Take a walk by Lake Eola, grab an arepa from a food truck, or find your new favorite band in a tucked-away bar.
    You don’t need a wristband for any of that.</p>
