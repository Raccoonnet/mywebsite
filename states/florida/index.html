    <h1>Florida: Sunlight, Salt, and Something Wild</h1>
    <p>
      Florida isn’t just beaches and retirees — it’s weird, wild, and deeply alive. 
      One day you’re chasing down Cuban coffee in Little Havana; the next you’re kayaking past cypress knees in a blackwater swamp. 
      Here, the line between paradise and mystery is razor thin. 
      <br><br>
      From the neon pulse of Miami to the moss-draped stillness of North Florida, this state runs on contradictions. 
      It's coastal and swampy, polished and raw, sun-drenched and storm-tossed. Florida doesn’t fit in a box. 
      It melts it.

    <h2>Cuisine: Citrus, Smoke & Coastal Heat</h2>
    <p>
      Florida’s food is as eclectic as its landscape — a blend of Caribbean, Southern, Latin, and swamp-born flavors. 
      You’ll find Cuban sandwiches that outshine the hype, smoked mullet by the bay, and conch fritters that taste like a sea breeze. 
      <br><br>
      North Florida leans barbecue and deep-fried. 
      South Florida turns up the heat with Haitian griot, Dominican mangu, and the freshest ceviche you’ll ever meet. 
      And everywhere? Key lime pie.

    <h2>Culture: Art, Rebellion & Palmetto Grit</h2>
    <p>
      Florida culture isn’t polished — it’s passionate, defiant, and sun-scorched. 
      From the pastel walls of Wynwood to the swamp punk of Gainesville’s music scene, this state pulses with outsider energy. 
      <br><br>
      You’ll find Cuban exiles preserving their homeland through food and politics, Seminole traditions living in the Everglades, and street art that competes with the skyline. 
      And somehow, in all this wild, Florida still dances — salsa in the streets, folk fests in small towns, EDM on South Beach rooftops.

    <h2>Coffee: Cafecito, Community, and Colliding Worlds</h2>
    <p>
      Coffee in Florida comes in many forms — from the quick, sweet thump of a cafecito in Miami to the indie brews of St. Pete’s art districts. 
      In college towns like Gainesville and Tallahassee, you’ll find used-book cafés filled with mismatched furniture and political debate. 
      <br><br>
      In beach towns, it’s less about the roast and more about the vibe: barefoot, sun-drenched, and maybe spiked with coconut milk. Florida coffee culture isn’t pretentious — it’s flavorful, local, and always caffeinated with attitude.

    <h2>Come Get Lost (And Found) in the Sunshine State</h2>
    <p>
      Florida isn’t clean edges and easy answers — it’s contradiction, humidity, and heart. 
      Whether you’re beachcombing in the Panhandle or bar-hopping through Wynwood, Florida leaves a mark. 
      This isn’t a place you just visit. 
      It’s one you experience, wrestle with, and come back to — whether you meant to or not.
