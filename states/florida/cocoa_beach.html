    <h1>Cocoa Beach, Florida: Laid-Back by Nature, Launch-Ready by Design</h1>
    <p>Cocoa Beach moves to the rhythm of the tides — unhurried, sun-faded, and undeniably Floridian. But it’s also a place with a pulse: rockets rumble the sky from nearby Cape Canaveral, surfers carve waves just a few blocks from NASA engineers sipping espresso, and longboarders cruise past beach bars with zero urgency.</p>
    <p>Whether you're here for a rocket launch, a sunrise surf session, or just to breathe in that salty Atlantic air, Cocoa Beach doesn’t ask much of you — just that you slow down and stay awhile.</p>

    <h2>Cuisine: Beach Eats with a Local Twist</h2>
    <p>Seafood dominates, but the best meals aren’t the flashy ones. Think mahi tacos with lime crema, Cuban sandwiches from roadside joints, and tiki bars serving grilled pineapple everything. Expect flip-flops at every table — and food that hits better with sea breeze.</p>

    <h2>Catch the Drift</h2>
    <p>Cocoa Beach doesn’t try to impress — it just <em>is</em>. That’s its power. Come for the rockets or the waves, but stay for the pace, the people, and the salty magic that makes this place feel like summer never ended.</p>
