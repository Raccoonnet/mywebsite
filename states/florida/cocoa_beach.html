  <h1>Cocoa Beach, Florida: Laid-Back by Nature, Launch-Ready by Design</h1>
  <div>

  </div>
  <p>
    Cocoa Beach moves to the rhythm of the tides — unhurried, sun-faded, and undeniably Floridian. But it’s also a
    place with a pulse: rockets rumble the sky from nearby Cape Canaveral, surfers carve waves just a few blocks from
    NASA engineers sipping espresso, and longboarders cruise past beach bars with zero urgency.
  </p>
  <p>
    Whether you're here for a rocket launch, a sunrise surf session, or just to breathe in that salty Atlantic air,
    Cocoa Beach doesn’t ask much of you — just that you slow down and stay awhile.

  <h2>Cuisine: Beach Eats with a Local Twist</h2>
  <p>
    You’ll never go hungry with the ocean just a block away.
    Seafood dominates, but the best meals aren’t the flashy ones.
    Think mahi tacos with lime crema, Cuban sandwiches from roadside joints, fish shacks that still feel like someone’s
    side hustle, and tiki bars serving grilled pineapple everything.
    Expect flip-flops at every table — and food that hits better with sea breeze.

  <h2>Culture: Surfboards, Space, and Salt-Air Stories</h2>
  <p>
    Cocoa Beach lives at the crossroads of surf and science.
    On one side: a laid-back surf culture that shaped legends like Kelly Slater.
    On the other: the Kennedy Space Center, still launching dreams into orbit.
    In between are locals who blend these worlds — engineers who surf before work, artists who paint rockets and waves.
    It’s not a place of highbrow museums. But it is full of personality, passion, and stories you won’t find anywhere
    else.

<!-- Coffee Section -->
<section>
  <h2>Coffee: Strong Brew, Ocean Views</h2>
  <p>
    Coffee here is casual, coastal, and often comes with a sandy floor.
    Expect small-batch brews served from surfside windows, tropical patio cafés, and spots where your iced latte might
    come with live ukulele.
    It’s less about fast caffeine and more about starting your day slow — maybe with your toes in the sand and your
    laptop left behind.

  <p>
    Cocoa Beach doesn’t try to impress — it just is. That’s its power.
    Come for the rockets or the waves, but stay for the pace, the people, and the salty magic that makes this place feel
    like summer never ended.
    No schedule needed — just sunscreen, curiosity, and maybe a board under your arm.
