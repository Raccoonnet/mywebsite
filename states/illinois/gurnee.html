    <h1>Gurnee, Illinois: Rollercoasters, Retail, and Suburban Calm</h1>
    <p>At first glance, Gurnee might look like a classic suburban stop along I-94 — the place where Chicagoland families head for outlet deals or thrill rides. But dig a little deeper and you’ll find a village with a slower rhythm just outside the noise. It’s not trying to be trendy. It’s comfortable. And for locals and weekenders alike, that’s exactly the point.</p>
