    <h1>Schaumburg, Illinois: Suburban Sprawl with a Surprising Pulse</h1>
    <p>Schaumburg is the kind of place people think they know — a classic Chicago suburb packed with office parks, shopping centers, and chain restaurants. And yes, it has all that. But what gets missed is the rhythm underneath: Korean bakeries tucked into strip malls, quiet nature preserves between highways, family-run shops, and locals who genuinely *like* where they live.</p>
    <p>It’s where suburban predictability meets pockets of authenticity — if you know where to look.</p>
