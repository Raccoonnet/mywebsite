    <h1>Iowa: Still Waters, Deep Roots</h1>
    <p>
      Iowa whispers where other places shout. 
      It’s the sound of wind through cornfields, the hush of morning fog over the Mississippi, the laughter of neighbors who’ve known each other for generations. 
      <br><br>
      This state doesn’t push itself into the spotlight — but if you slow down and stay awhile, it reveals something lasting. 
      A strong sense of place. Fierce community pride. And a surprising creative pulse hiding in the spaces between the rows.

    <h2>Cuisine: Straightforward, Seasonal, and From-Scratch</h2>
    <p>
      Food in Iowa is honest. Not flashy, not fussy — just made right. 
      Expect sweet corn in July that barely needs butter, rhubarb pies cooled on porches, and pork tenderloins the size of your face. 
      <br><br>
      But there’s evolution here too. Des Moines’ food scene is growing bold: Laotian noodle joints, farm-to-table bistros, and cafes baking with heritage grains. You can eat like a farmer or like a foodie — often at the same table.

    <h2>Culture: Writers, Quilters, and a Quiet Kind of Bold</h2>
    <p>
      Iowa is the unexpected cultural heavyweight of the Midwest. 
      It’s home to the Iowa Writers' Workshop, which has shaped some of the most influential authors in America. 
      Its art galleries are small but intentional. Its county fairs? Legendary. 
      <br><br>
      You’ll find murals in small towns, cello concerts in cornfields, and some of the best bookstores anywhere. 
      This is a place that values voice — even if it speaks softly.

    <h2>Coffee: Slower Sips, Stronger Roots</h2>
    <p>
      In Iowa, coffee shops often double as general stores, bakeries, or community bulletin boards. 
      It’s about connection as much as caffeine. 
      <br><br>
      But don’t mistake casual for mediocre. From pour-overs in Iowa City to indie roasters in Ames and Des Moines, the state has serious coffee game — just without the pretension. 
      You’ll get a great cup, a genuine chat, and probably a homemade cookie too.

    <h2>Leave the Highway. Iowa’s Waiting</h2>
    <p>
      This isn’t a drive-by state. Iowa asks you to take the back roads. Pull over for pie. 
      Talk to someone who’s lived on the same land for 70 years. 
      You’ll leave with fewer photos but more stories. And that’s exactly the point.
