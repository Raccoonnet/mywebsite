    <h1>Texas: Vast Lands, Big Stories</h1>
    <p>
      Texas is a state where every horizon seems endless, and every town tells a story as big as its skies. 
      From the spirited streets of Austin to the historic Alamo in San Antonio and the sprawling oil fields that powered its rise, Texas is a blend of rugged independence, vibrant culture, and deep-rooted traditions. 
      <br><br>
      It’s a place where barbecue smoke drifts over the hill country, where music festivals bring people together, and where the diversity of landscapes—from deserts to piney woods—invites endless exploration.
