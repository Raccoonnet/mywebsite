    <h1>Fort Worth, Texas: Where Western Heritage Meets Urban Charm</h1>
    <p>
      Nestled just west of Dallas, Fort Worth proudly carries its nickname, “Cowtown,” but it’s much more than rodeos and cattle drives. 
      Here, history and modernity blend seamlessly — from the historic stockyards echoing with the spirit of the Old West to contemporary museums, live music, and culinary adventures that reflect a thriving metropolitan area.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fort Worth’s charm comes from its contrasts: the wide-open feel of the prairie meets bustling urban neighborhoods; cowboy hats mingle with art-goers at world-class museums. 
      Walking along the downtown Sundance Square or exploring the cultural district, it’s easy to sense a city that honors its roots while looking confidently toward the future.
