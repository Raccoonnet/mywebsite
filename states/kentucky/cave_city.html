    <h1>Cave City, Kentucky: Underground Wonder, Small-Town Welcome</h1>
    <p>
      Cave City moves at a different pace — one shaped by rock and time. 
      Just minutes from the mouth of Mammoth Cave, it’s a town where everything feels a bit more grounded. 
      Locals have grown up with the world’s longest known cave system in their backyard, but that wonder doesn’t make them jaded — it just makes them good at slowing down and noticing things.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a place where people still run small businesses, wave you into traffic, and talk about the weather like it’s the news. There’s no rush here. No flash. Just good food, friendly folks, and more natural beauty than one weekend can hold. 
      Cave City isn’t just a gateway to Mammoth Cave — it’s a place with a spirit all its own.

    <h2>Cuisine: Country Cooking, Done Right</h2>
    <p>
      In Cave City, food isn’t about being fancy — it’s about being right. 
      You’ll find meat-and-three diners, biscuits that flake like your grandma made them, and barbecue joints where the smoke hits you before the sign does. 
      Southern staples dominate — fried catfish, cornbread, pulled pork, and collard greens. 
      A few places lean modern with locally sourced spins, but even then, it’s all rooted in tradition. 
      You’re not just eating here — you’re being fed.

    <h2>More Than a Gateway</h2>
    <p>
      Cave City might get overshadowed by what’s beneath it — but it’s more than a stop on the way to the caves. 
      It’s a community, a landscape, and a feeling. 
      One that sneaks up on you in the best way. 
      So yes, come for the caves — but stay for what’s above ground, too.
