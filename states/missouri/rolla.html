    <h1>Rolla, Missouri: Brains, Backroads, and a Bit of Grit</h1>
    <p>
      Rolla sits in the middle of Missouri — geographically and in spirit. 
      It’s where engineers and geologists brush shoulders with farmers and floaters. 
      A town of about 20,000, Rolla is home to Missouri University of Science and Technology (Missouri S&T) — one of the top engineering schools in the country — but it’s also surrounded by national forests, winding rivers, and trails that call to weekend wanderers.
    </p>
    <p>
      There’s a quirky charm here. 
      Historic buildings downtown are packed with books, antiques, and sandwiches bigger than your head. 
      Students from all over the world bring energy and diversity to this otherwise laid-back Ozarks town. 
      And Route 66 nostalgia still lingers on the edges — in old motels, classic signage, and the occasional vintage car rally. 
      Rolla doesn’t try to impress you. It just shows up, does the work, and offers you a cold drink afterward. 
      And that’s kind of its magic.

    <h2>Cuisine: Fuel for Hikers, Students, and Everyone in Between</h2>
    <p>
      The food scene in Rolla knows who it’s feeding: hardworking students, travelers, professors, and outdoor types looking to refuel. 
      Expect hearty breakfasts, oversized burgers, international surprises (thanks to the student population), and local joints that haven’t changed in 30 years — and shouldn’t. 
      You’ll find Thai, Indian, Greek, and Middle Eastern menus alongside BBQ, biscuits and gravy, and hand-tossed pizzas. 
      It's eclectic, unfussy, and surprisingly diverse for a town its size.

    <h2>Culture: Engineering Meets Folk Wisdom</h2>
    <p>
      Rolla’s cultural life is a quiet but fascinating blend — where STEM brains and small-town traditions meet. 
      The biggest cultural event? 
      St. Pat’s Week, when Missouri S&T transforms the town with parades, painted streets, concerts, and green gear everywhere. 
      The town also supports the arts through Arts Rolla, local theater productions, and frequent music nights at parks or coffee shops. 
      Heritage groups keep Ozarks history alive, while students bring global flavors and music to the table.

    <h2>Coffee: Study Spots, Chill Corners, and Strong Brews</h2>
    <p>
      Rolla’s coffee scene thrives because it has to — when you’re home to thousands of engineers-in-training, caffeine is survival. 
      But it’s more than that. 
      Local shops offer space to unwind, study, meet, or people-watch on a slow Saturday. 
      Expect quality espresso, home-baked treats, and cozy couches with a side of wi-fi. 
      Some cafés double as art galleries or event spaces, adding to the small-town-meets-intellectual vibe that defines Rolla.

    <h2>Smart, Grounded, and Full of Character</h2>
    <p>
      Rolla doesn’t try to compete with big cities. 
      Instead, it offers something rarer — an honest, grounded community with depth, history, and curiosity. 
      Whether you’re wandering a trail, debating over coffee, or watching St. Pat’s crowds spill down Pine Street, you’ll find a town that embraces both its brainpower and its boots-on-the-ground spirit.
