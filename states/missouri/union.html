    <h1>Union, Missouri: Historic Charm with a Warm, Small-Town Spirit</h1>
    <p>
      Tucked along the Bourbeuse River, Union feels like the kind of place where time takes a gentler pace. 
      It’s the county seat of Franklin County — a community woven from craftsmanship, family roots, and a quiet pride that shows in the details: a restored downtown mural, a handshake at the farmer’s market, or the laughter echoing from a Friday night ball game.
    </p>
    <p>
      Union blends the warmth of small-town life with easy access to the rolling hills of Missouri wine country. 
      Here, everyone seems to know someone, and visitors quickly feel less like outsiders and more like neighbors.

    <h2>Cuisine: Comfort Food with Local Flavor</h2>
    <p>
      Union’s dining culture is delightfully down-to-earth — where the menus are short, the portions generous, and the conversations easy. 
      Local barbecue joints and family diners form the heart of its food scene, alongside a few unexpected gems like bakeries and taverns tucked along the main strip. 
      On summer evenings, the scent of grilled meat and sweet corn fills the air at community events and ballparks — a sure sign that food here is as much about connection as it is about flavor.

    <h2>Coffee: Gathering Spots with Character</h2>
    <p>
      If you want to feel the pulse of Union, stop by a local café on a weekday morning. 
      The regulars gather early — farmers, teachers, and retirees — talking about weather, high school sports, and the day ahead. 
      The coffee’s good, but it’s the company that keeps people coming back. 
      A few newer spots have brought a modern touch to town — pour-overs, lattes, and spaces where creativity meets caffeine — yet Union’s charm still lies in its sense of belonging.
