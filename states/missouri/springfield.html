    <h1>Springfield, Missouri: Where the Ozarks Begin</h1>
    <p>
      Springfield doesn’t put on airs. 
      It’s not trying to be something it’s not — which is exactly what makes it so magnetic. 
      Often called the “Queen City of the Ozarks,” it’s a place where city energy and country pace coexist in an oddly comfortable rhythm. 
      You can sip third-wave espresso downtown, hike a cave trail by noon, and catch a live bluegrass band before the night’s out.
    </p>
    <p>
      It’s the birthplace of Route 66, the home of Bass Pro’s original flagship store, and a gateway to all things Ozarks. 
      But Springfield’s deeper story is about locals — fiercely proud, quietly creative, and quick to welcome newcomers with a plate of cashew chicken or a tip on the best float route. 
      This isn’t a city that’s trying to go big. It’s a city that knows who it is — and leans in.

    <h2>Cuisine: Cashew Chicken, Craft Burgers, and Ozarks Comfort</h2>
    <p>
      Let’s get one thing straight: Springfield-style cashew chicken is not your average takeout order — it’s a local legend. 
      Created here in the 1960s, it’s a crispy-fried, gravy-smothered icon you’ll find on nearly every menu in town. 
      But Springfield’s food scene goes deeper. 
      Think smoky BBQ, craft burgers, fresh-from-the-farm produce, and food trucks tucked in brewery lots. 
      International flavors are gaining ground too — Vietnamese, Thai, and Ethiopian spots are making their mark, especially near the university district.

    <h2>Culture: Route 66 Vibes, Underground Theaters, and Ozark Stories</h2>
    <p>
      Springfield’s culture lives in the in-between. 
      Between the Ozark hills and city skyline. 
      Between honky-tonk and indie rock. Between revival and reinvention. 
      You’ll see it in the Gillioz Theatre, where vaudeville meets vintage film night. 
      In basement art galleries and historic churches-turned-music-venues. 
      In the city’s deep reverence for Route 66 history, and in the stories told through public murals and poetry slams. 
      And every First Friday, downtown wakes up — galleries open, musicians spill into the streets, and locals gather not just to see art, but to make it.

    <h2>Coffee: Chill Vibes, Creative Corners, and Community Brews</h2>
    <p>
      Springfield’s coffee scene has heart. 
      These aren’t just places to grab a latte — they’re community hubs, remote work zones, and creative refuges. 
      Locals linger. Musicians busk nearby. Writers claim their favorite tables. 
      You’ll find shops in old banks, garages, even greenhouses — each with its own personality. 
      Baristas here take their beans seriously but don’t take themselves too seriously. 
      Expect warmth, strong pours, and at least one hand-painted tip jar.

    <h2>Honest, Creative, and Unexpectedly Cool</h2>
    <p>
      Springfield isn’t shouting to get your attention. 
      It’s just doing its thing — and doing it well. 
      Whether you come for the history, the trails, the cashew chicken, or just to feel something real, you’ll find a city that’s welcoming, weird, and entirely its own.
