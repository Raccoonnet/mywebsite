    <h1>Clayton, Missouri: Sophisticated, Walkable, and Still a Neighborhood</h1>
    <p>
      Clayton has a reputation — and it’s earned. 
      It’s polished, professional, and unmistakably upscale. 
      But spend time here, and you’ll find more than sleek office towers and luxury condos. 
      You’ll find walkable streets, tree-lined parks, and a food scene with quiet ambition. 
      It’s where suits and strollers share sidewalks, where modern art lives steps from historic homes, and where a café table can feel like your second office — or your weekend retreat. 
      Clayton knows what it is, and it doesn’t have to try too hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you’re looking for a Missouri city that’s refined but real, Clayton is it.

    <h2>Cuisine: Global Palates in a 2-Mile Radius</h2>
    <p>
      Clayton’s food scene packs a lot into a small footprint — and it doesn’t miss. 
      Upscale French bistros sit next to ramen bars, farm-to-table spots, and wine bars with serious cellar depth. 
      It’s not trying to be trendy — it’s just good at what it does. 
      Lunch hours are full of professionals; evenings bring in date nights and quiet celebrations. 
      This is the kind of place where you make a reservation — and where the bread basket is never an afterthought.

    <h2>Culture: Art Fairs, Park Life, and the Quiet Pulse of the City</h2>
    <p>
      Culture in Clayton comes softly — through outdoor sculpture, neighborhood concerts, and one of the best art fairs in the country. 
      Shaw Park is the city’s green heart, with trails, a community pool, tennis courts, and summer festivals. 
      The business district is full of galleries, indie shops, and seasonal displays. 
      You won’t find megavenues or loud nightlife — but you will find elegance, quality, and care in everything.

    <h2>Coffee: Work, Relax, Repeat</h2>
    <p>
      In Clayton, cafés double as conference rooms, study spots, and solo escape hatches. 
      There’s a refined coffee culture here — where the beans matter, the lighting is good, and the staff know how to pull a clean shot. 
      Local spots coexist with polished chains, but the vibe is always thoughtful, never rushed. 
      Whether you’re plugging in or catching up, there’s always room at the table.

    <h2>Isn’t Just Polished — It’s Personal</h2>
    <p>
      It might look like a corporate center on paper, but Clayton has real heartbeat. 
      It’s lived in, not just passed through. 
      Families settle here for the schools and safety; professionals stay for the lifestyle. 
      It’s a small city with big presence — and it keeps its promises.
