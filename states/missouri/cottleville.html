    <h1>Cottleville, Missouri: Where Small Town Feels New Again</h1>
    <p>
      Cottleville isn’t trying to be flashy — and that’s exactly why people love it. 
      It’s one of those towns where the sidewalks are busy on a Friday night, not with tourists, but with neighbors. 
      Where the coffee shop knows your order, the brewery hosts your kid’s soccer fundraiser, and the walking trails are as much social space as they are scenic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tucked between busier suburbs, Cottleville has quietly become one of Missouri’s best-kept secrets — equal parts historic charm and thoughtful growth. 
      If you're after a community that’s cozy, connected, and just a little bit cool, this is your place.

    <h2>Cuisine: Casual Dining, Local Vibe</h2>
    <p>
      Cottleville may be small, but it knows how to eat well. 
      Think elevated bar food, wood-fired pizza, and patios that fill up the moment the weather’s nice. 
      Family-run kitchens and neighborhood bars are the norm here — spots where kids and dogs are welcome, and where the staff recognize regulars by name. 
      The food isn’t pretentious. 
      It’s fresh, satisfying, and usually paired with a good local beer or glass of wine. 
      Bonus: You’re almost always close to live music or a community event.

      Cottleville’s cultural life is rooted in gathering — from parades and park concerts to quirky holiday events and massive town picnics. 
      Its historic core is small but mighty, with restored buildings housing boutiques, tasting rooms, and one of the most popular wine gardens in the region. 
      Art shows, pop-up vendor markets, and local theater groups give the town a creative heartbeat — and there’s always something happening in Legacy Park.

    <h2>Coffee: Morning Walks & Porch Conversations</h2>
    <p>
      You’ll find the coffee scene here nestled into community rhythms — a couple of well-loved cafés where people linger, not rush. 
      It’s less about “third wave” and more about connection — good espresso, scratch-made pastries, and familiar faces behind the counter. 
      You might see a teacher grading papers, a group of moms catching up after drop-off, or a local band planning their next gig. 
      It’s not about volume — it’s about vibe.
