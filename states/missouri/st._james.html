    <h1>St. James, Missouri: Small Town, Big Pour</h1>
    <p>
      Tucked just off I-44 in the northern Ozarks, St. James is the kind of place you might miss if you blink — but don’t. 
      Because this little town has a knack for surprising people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Known as “Missouri’s Wine Country Gateway,” St. James is a place where vineyards hug the hills, barbecue smokes slow into the evening, and folks still wave from the porch. There's a rhythm here that feels older than time — part vineyard, part roadside Americana, part proud small-town grit. 
      Whether you’re pulling in for a glass of Norton at the local winery, a stop along historic Route 66, or just a slower pace of life, St. James knows how to welcome strangers like family.

    <h2>Cuisine: Wine, Smoke, and Ozark Comfort</h2>
    <p>
      In St. James, food is closely tied to what grows nearby and what’s worth slowing down for. 
      The town's wineries often serve elevated small plates — local cheeses, meats, and pastries — made to pair with bold Missouri reds and easy-sipping whites. 
      But you’ll also find no-frills diners, BBQ joints with wood pits out back, and even food trucks during festivals serving up pulled pork sandwiches, kettle corn, and fried pie. 
      It’s simple, soulful food with a lot of pride behind it.

    <h2>Culture: Vineyards, Vintage, and the Spirit of the Trail</h2>
    <p>
      St. James may be small, but its cultural story is bigger than you’d expect. 
      The Grape & Fall Festival is the town’s crown jewel — a celebration of harvest, heritage, and handcrafts that’s been going strong for over 80 years. 
      You’ll see Route 66 nostalgia everywhere — hand-painted signs, old diners, restored motels. 
      But there's also a quiet, growing arts scene: potters, woodworkers, and painters selling from their garages or booths at festivals. 
      History lives on at Maramec Spring Park, a 19th-century ironworks site turned peaceful, trout-stocked nature retreat.

    <h2>Coffee: Small Batch, Small Talk, and Local Love</h2>
    <p>
      St. James doesn’t have a big coffee scene — but what it has, it pours with heart. 
      Think mom-and-pop cafés serving drip coffee strong enough to get you through a chilly Ozark morning. 
      A couple local bakeries and lunch spots brew solid espresso and know your name by the second visit. 
      This is the kind of place where you’ll overhear high school football scores, farming updates, and community gossip — all over a biscuit sandwich and a bottomless cup.

    <h2>St. James, MO: Quiet Roads, Bold Wines, and Front Porch Moments</h2>
    <p>
      St. James doesn’t have flashing lights or five-star hotels. 
      What it does have is heart — rooted in tradition, poured into every glass, and written in the smiles of the people who call it home. 
      If you’re looking for a break from fast living, this little Ozark town might just be your next favorite stop.
