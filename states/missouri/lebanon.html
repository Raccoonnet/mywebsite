    <h1>Lebanon, Missouri: Route 66 Heartbeat with Ozark Soul</h1>
    <p>
      Lebanon doesn’t put on a show — and that’s exactly why it stands out. 
      Tucked into the northern edge of the Ozarks, this is a place where the road hums beneath your tires, the skies stretch wide, and the people still wave from porches. 
      It’s a Route 66 town at its core, and you can feel that nostalgia in the neon signs, vintage motels, and tucked-away diners. 
      But there’s more here than old highways and road trip charm. 
      Lebanon is a community built on grit and kindness — with trout streams, craft fairs, and a rhythm that’s slower, steadier, and refreshingly unpolished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether you're hiking at Bennett Spring, grabbing a slice downtown, or walking through a car show on a warm Friday night, Lebanon greets you with that quiet kind of welcome that sticks.

    <h2>Cuisine: Hearty, Local, and Unapologetically Ozark</h2>
    <p>
      Lebanon’s food scene isn’t flashy — it’s satisfying. 
      Think home-style diners where the biscuits are scratch-made and the coffee’s still bottomless. 
      There’s BBQ done right, catfish fried golden, and pie that could pass for your grandma’s. 
      You’ll also find newer cafés and bakeries that bring a little creativity into the mix — and farm-to-fork spots popping up with a fresh take on Missouri roots. 
      If you eat like a local here, you’ll eat well — and probably leave with leftovers.

    <h2>Culture: Classic Americana with a Small-Town Spark</h2>
    <p>
      There’s a strong pulse of culture in Lebanon, but it’s not about galleries or highbrow concerts. 
      It’s in the lawn chairs lining Main Street for parades, the guitars picked under park pavilions, and the local high school theater shows that pack a house. 
      Route 66 gives it a built-in cultural identity — you’ll see it in murals, vintage signage, and museum exhibits that proudly celebrate the town’s highway heritage. 
      But Lebanon also looks forward: art guild events, handmade markets, and a community that still values showing up in person.

    <h2>Coffee: Comfort, Conversation, and That Familiar Mug</h2>
    <p>
      Coffee in Lebanon feels like a pause. 
      It’s cozy cafés where regulars sit with the morning paper, students recharge between classes, and folks gather to catch up. 
      Some spots are tucked into downtown buildings; others are drive-thrus with surprisingly good espresso. 
      The vibe is local, welcoming, and unhurried — like everything else in Lebanon. 
      This isn’t about trends; it’s about connection.

    <h2>A Town That Lets You Slow Down and Stay Awhile</h2>
    <p>
      Lebanon is a reminder that charm doesn’t have to be curated. 
      It’s lived-in, genuine, and quietly proud of where it’s been — and where it’s going. 
      You don’t need a tour guide here. 
      Just follow the hum of the highway, the scent of BBQ in the air, and the sound of someone strumming a guitar on a front porch. 
      This is the kind of town that doesn’t change for visitors — and that’s what makes it worth visiting.
