    <h1>Cuba, Missouri: Small Town Heart with a Route 66 Soul</h1>
    <p>
      Cuba is the kind of town where the past isn’t just remembered — it’s painted across buildings, built into breakfast counters, and baked into the stories people still tell on front porches. 
      Tucked in the Ozarks of central Missouri, Cuba is best known for its larger-than-life murals and its proud place on old Route 66. But spend a little time here, and you’ll find something deeper than nostalgia. 
      There’s an unpolished honesty to Cuba — a mix of road-trip charm, down-home hospitality, and a creative spirit that keeps it all alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you're chasing Americana that feels lived-in (not re-created), Cuba’s got your next stop.

    <h2>Cuisine: Fried, Fresh, and Unpretentious</h2>
    <p>
      Cuba’s food scene leans into the kind of meals that satisfy more than impress. 
      Think big breakfasts, hot pies, and fried catfish done right. 
      Local diners and old-school cafes line the highway, many of them unchanged for decades — in the best way. 
      But there’s more here than just diner food. 
      A few thoughtful chefs and restaurateurs have brought fresh takes to familiar fare: smoked meats, wood-fired pizza, craft brews, and even scratch-made desserts that’ll surprise you.

    <h2>Culture: Murals, Music, and Missouri Pride</h2>
    <p>
      Art is everywhere in Cuba — quite literally. 
      Known as "Route 66 Mural City", Cuba has embraced public art with heart. 
      The downtown murals tell stories of pioneers, presidents, and local legends, all woven into the town’s visual identity. 
      Cuba’s cultural pride also shows up in festivals, antique shops, and the way the town rallies around its local artists. 
      Whether it’s folk musicians playing under tents or school kids painting their first mural, creativity lives here.

    <h2>Coffee: Cozy Corners with a Personal Touch</h2>
    <p>
      Coffee in Cuba feels more like a pause than a rush. 
      Small cafés offer hand-poured brews, simple pastries, and the kind of friendliness you don’t have to earn. 
      You’ll likely meet the owner, swap stories with the barista, and walk out with more than just caffeine. 
      It's the kind of place where you sip slowly, talk longer, and maybe leave with a business card or two — because around here, people still connect over a cup.

    <h2>The Heartbeat of Historic Highway Living</h2>
    <p>
      Some towns cling to history. Cuba carries it proudly — and keeps moving. 
      It's not frozen in time, but it knows exactly where it came from. 
      With each painted wall, passed-down recipe, and neighborly handshake, you’ll feel the rhythm of a town that still believes in its story. 
      And once you visit, you might believe in it too.
