    <h1>Ohio: Where Innovation Meets Tradition</h1>
    <p>
      Ohio is a place of dynamic contrasts — from bustling cities like Cleveland and Cincinnati to rolling farmland and serene lakeshores along Lake Erie. 
      The Buckeye State balances rich history with a forward-thinking spirit, whether in its museums, music scenes, or thriving industries. 
      <br><br>
      It’s where rock ‘n’ roll legends were born, where hearty Midwestern cuisine fills the table, and where the people are as warm and welcoming as the summer sun.
