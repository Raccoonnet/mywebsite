    <h1>Cleveland, Ohio: A Resilient City of Arts, Lakes, and Soul</h1>
    <p>
      Perched on the southern shore of Lake Erie, Cleveland is a city that wears its grit and glory with equal pride. 
      Once a booming industrial powerhouse, today it’s a city of reinvention — where world-class arts, sports passion, and lakeside charm meet neighborhoods that still hold the stories of generations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cleveland feels alive in small details: the hum of traffic near Public Square, the aroma of fresh pierogis drifting from Little Italy, or the distant cheers from a Cavaliers game at the Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse. 
      It’s a city that invites curiosity, where every street corner whispers history, and every new restaurant or gallery hints at a city continuously evolving.
