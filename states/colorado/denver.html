    <h1>Denver, Colorado: Where Altitude Meets Attitude</h1>
    <p>
      Denver doesn’t pretend to be perfect — that’s part of its charm. 
      It’s a city of mashups: cowboy grit meets tech startup, microbrews meet mountaintop views, Victorian houses stand shoulder to shoulder with modern glass towers. 
      All under 300 days of sun a year.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a place that knows how to work hard and chill harder. 
      Whether you’re hiking at sunrise or grabbing happy hour in RiNo, Denver doesn’t ask you to choose between city life and outdoor freedom — it hands you both on the same day.

    <h2>Cuisine: Rocky Mountain Flavor, Without the Fuss</h2>
    <p>
      Denver doesn’t obsess over “foodie culture” — it just makes great food and lets you find it. 
      Green chile is practically a religion here (and yes, you’ll pick a side), but the scene’s evolved into something far more layered: street tacos with house-made tortillas, chef-led foraging menus, creative vegan spots, and plenty of places still proudly serving chicken-fried steak. 
      Add dozens of breweries, distilleries, and craft cideries, and you’ve got a food culture that doesn’t need to brag — it just feeds you well.

    <h2>Culture: Scrappy, Artistic, and Always Creating</h2>
    <p>
      Denver’s cultural scene is rooted in community. 
      Murals stretch across entire city blocks. Art collectives pop up in converted warehouses. 
      You can go from a symphony performance to a basement punk show in the same night. 
      And you should. 
      History isn’t just preserved — it’s lived. 
      From the rail yards to the jazz clubs of Five Points, there’s a spirit here that respects its roots while reaching for what’s next.

  <section>
    <h2>Coffee: Strong Beans, Stronger Identity</h2>
    <p>
      Denver takes its coffee seriously — but without the snobbery. 
      You’ll find roasters who know every detail about their beans, but still serve it with a smile. 
      Cafés double as coworking spots, vinyl shops, and sometimes bike repair stations. 
      There’s a deep local pride to the coffee scene — you’ll feel it in the brew and the vibe.

    <h2>Mile High, Wide Open</h2>
    <p>
      Denver invites you to stay curious. 
      Explore a new neighborhood. 
      Climb a mountain before lunch. 
      Sip a nitro cold brew and catch a street poet on the same block. 
      It’s a city that gives you room to breathe — and reasons to keep coming back.
