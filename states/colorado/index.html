    <h1>Colorado: Altitude, Attitude, and the Wild Between</h1>
    <p>
      Colorado isn’t just about elevation — it’s about perspective. Whether you're waking up to the gold shimmer
      of aspens in Telluride or watching the sun set behind Denver’s skyline, the landscape constantly rearranges
      how you see the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      It’s a state shaped by geologic force and human grit. A place where artists, athletes, ranchers, and engineers
      coexist under 300 days of sun. Colorado doesn’t just ask you to visit. It dares you to stay awake to it all.

    <h2>Cuisine: Bold Flavors at High Altitudes</h2>
    <p>
      Colorado’s food scene blends mountain ruggedness with big-city ambition. 
      Expect green chile on everything in the south, elk burgers in ski towns, and rooftop ramen bars in downtown Denver. 
      It's a state where food is tied to adventure — hearty meals after hikes, or local brews by the fire. 
      <br><br>
      Farm-to-table isn’t a buzzword here — it’s default. 
      Bison, trout, Palisade peaches, Pueblo chiles — everything tastes fresher at altitude.

    <h2>Culture: Trail Dust Meets Avant-Garde</h2>
    <p>
      Colorado’s culture stretches wide — from Indigenous storytelling and cowboy poetry to experimental jazz in warehouse galleries. 
      Denver balances street art and symphony. Boulder brims with bookstores, festivals, and eco-activism. 
      Even the smallest mountain towns host folk nights and fiber arts workshops. 
      <br><br>
      It’s a creative, self-starting kind of place — the kind where people build community from scratch and still wave to strangers.

    <h2>Coffee: Altitude-Fueled Creativity</h2>
    <p>
      Coffee in Colorado is both ritual and rebellion. 
      In Denver, cafés double as co-working spaces and late-night music venues. 
      In towns like Fort Collins or Salida, roasters are community pillars — the kind that remember your order and your dog’s name. 
      <br><br>
      Baristas here care about the roast profile and the mountain water they brew it with. 
      Whether you’re sipping at 5,000 feet or 10,000, the coffee scene feels handcrafted and grounded.

    <h2>Don’t Just Visit — Live It</h2>
    <p>
      Colorado rewards attention. Whether you're scrambling up a scree field or people-watching on Pearl Street, the magic is in the details — and the altitude doesn’t hurt either. 
      This is a place that invites you to breathe deeper, move slower, and feel more alive.
