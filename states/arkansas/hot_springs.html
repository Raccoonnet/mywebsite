    <h1>Hot Springs, Arkansas: Where History Steams and Nature Heals</h1>
    <p>
      Nestled in the Ouachita Mountains, Hot Springs is a place where water isn’t just water — it’s legend, medicine, and ritual. 
      This small city blends Southern charm with a raw, untamed spirit that’s been drawing seekers, gangsters, and healers for over a century. 
      The thermal springs still bubble beneath Bathhouse Row, but there’s more here than steamy water: walkable streets full of art deco architecture, quirky cafes, deep forest trails, and a laid-back pace that makes you want to linger.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a city where the line between wild and cultured is beautifully blurred — and that’s exactly the point.

    <h2>Culture: Soaked in Story, Stirred by Sound</h2>
    <p>
      Hot Springs has always been a little different — and proud of it. 
      From Al Capone’s favorite bathhouse to today's indie film scene, this city celebrates its contradictions. 
      Art deco buildings house tattoo studios and jazz nights. 
      The town’s outlaw energy from the early 20th century still simmers beneath the surface, but it’s softened now by creativity and community. 
      The arts are local, live, and thriving.
