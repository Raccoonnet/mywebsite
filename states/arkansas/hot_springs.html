    <h1>Hot Springs, Arkansas: Where History Steams and Nature Heals</h1>
    <p>Nestled in the Ouachita Mountains, <strong>Hot Springs</strong> is a place where water isn’t just water — it’s legend, medicine, and ritual. 
    This small city blends Southern charm with a raw, untamed spirit that’s been drawing seekers, gangsters, and healers for over a century. 
    The thermal springs still bubble beneath Bathhouse Row, but there’s more here than steamy water: walkable streets full of art deco architecture, quirky cafes, deep forest trails, and a laid-back pace that makes you want to linger.</p>

    <p>This is a city where the line between wild and cultured is beautifully blurred — and that’s exactly the point.</p>
