    <h1>Vinita, Oklahoma: A Crossroads Town with Deep Roots</h1>
  </header>

  <!-- Introduction -->
  <section id="introduction">
    <p>
      Vinita sits quietly in northeastern Oklahoma, a town shaped by intersections—of rail lines, highways, and histories that stretch far beyond its modest size. At first glance, Vinita feels like a classic small Midwestern town, but spending time here reveals layers of significance that belie its population.
    </p>
    <p>
      The town’s story is closely tied to transportation and early settlement. Vinita was one of the first incorporated towns in what was then Indian Territory, and its development followed the arrival of the railroad in the late nineteenth century.
    </p>
    <p>
      What defines Vinita today is its calm persistence. Life moves at a measured pace, shaped by long-standing routines, familiar faces, and a strong sense of place.
