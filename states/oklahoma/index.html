  <!-- Introduction -->
  <section id="introduction">
    <p>
      Oklahoma has a way of surprising people. From the car window, it might first appear as an endless sweep of open land, but stay awhile and you begin to notice how layered and expressive it really is. Tallgrass prairies ripple in the wind, red dirt roads cut through rolling hills, and wide skies stretch so far they seem to hold entire stories within them. This is a place shaped by movement—of Native nations, settlers, oil booms, musicians, and everyday people carving out a life rooted in resilience.
    </p>
    <p>
      The state sits at a geographic and cultural crossroads. Parts of Oklahoma feel Southern, others unmistakably Western or Midwestern, and often all three blend together in the same town. History here is present, not polished away. You see it in restored Route 66 signs, tribal nations maintaining language and tradition, and small towns where high school football and Friday night dinners still matter deeply.
    </p>
    <p>
      What I love most about Oklahoma is how quietly it invites you in. People wave on back roads. Conversations linger. There’s pride here—not loud or flashy, but steady. Whether you’re standing in a windswept field at sunset or walking through a growing city neighborhood, Oklahoma feels like a place that rewards curiosity and patience.

  <section id="cuisine">
    <h2>Cuisine: Bites of the Sooner State</h2>
    <p>
      Oklahoma food is rooted in comfort and community. Many dishes here tell stories of necessity, blending Native American, Southern, and frontier influences into meals meant to sustain and bring people together. Fry bread is perhaps the most iconic example—simple, filling, and deeply connected to Native history.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barbecue also holds an important place, though Oklahoma doesn’t cling to a single rigid style. Chicken-fried steak remains a diner staple, while onion burgers—born during the Great Depression—are still celebrated for their humble brilliance.
    </p>
    <p>
      In recent years, Oklahoma’s cities have embraced creative kitchens blending global flavors with local ingredients. Food here isn’t about trends; it’s about feeding people well and giving them a reason to linger at the table.

    <h2>Culture: Threads of Tradition</h2>
    <p>
      Culture in Oklahoma is something you experience rather than observe. Native American nations play a central role in the state’s identity, contributing to language, art, and living traditions that continue to shape everyday life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Music runs just as deep. From classic country to red dirt rock, Oklahoma’s sound reflects themes of place, hardship, and freedom, often performed in intimate venues where artists and audiences feel closely connected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Art, festivals, and storytelling thrive across the state. Oklahoma culture isn’t about spectacle—it’s about participation, community, and passing stories forward.

  <section id="coffee">
    <h2>Coffee: Brews & Conversations</h2>
    <p>
      Coffee culture in Oklahoma is relaxed and personal. Independent cafés act as gathering spaces where conversations linger and routines feel familiar. Many roasters take pride in thoughtful sourcing and slow-crafted drinks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether in a city neighborhood or a small town square, coffee here is less about urgency and more about connection.

      Oklahoma doesn’t demand attention—it earns it. Through open landscapes, generous people, and a steady sense of place, it offers something deeper than a quick visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Come with curiosity, take your time, and let the state reveal itself in its own way.
