    <h1>Tulsa, Oklahoma: Art Deco Elegance and Oklahoma Grit</h1>
  </header>

  <!-- Introduction -->
  <section id="introduction">
    <p>
      Tulsa is a city built on contrasts that somehow fit together seamlessly. Oil money and working-class neighborhoods, prairie skies and polished Art Deco towers, deep history and ongoing reinvention all coexist here. Sitting along the Arkansas River in northeastern Oklahoma, Tulsa feels both grounded and quietly ambitious—a place that has learned how to honor its past while steadily reshaping its future.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the early twentieth century, oil transformed Tulsa almost overnight, earning it the nickname “Oil Capital of the World.” That wealth left behind a remarkable architectural legacy, especially downtown, where Art Deco buildings still define the skyline. At the same time, Tulsa carries the weight of difficult history, including the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre, which continues to shape conversations around justice, memory, and community responsibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today’s Tulsa is thoughtful and creative. Neighborhoods feel distinct and lived-in, local businesses anchor daily life, and the city’s energy comes less from spectacle and more from people invested in making their home better. Tulsa doesn’t rush to impress—it invites you to stay long enough to understand it.

    <h2>Cuisine: Where Tradition Meets Creative Confidence</h2>
    <p>
      Tulsa’s food scene reflects its growing confidence as a cultural city. Longtime staples—barbecue joints, diners, and family-run Mexican restaurants—continue to thrive, offering familiar flavors that generations of Tulsans grew up with. These places anchor neighborhoods and remain essential to the city’s identity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alongside tradition, Tulsa’s culinary landscape has expanded in thoughtful ways. Chef-driven restaurants, modern bakeries, and globally inspired kitchens now share space with legacy establishments. You’ll find influences ranging from Vietnamese and Ethiopian to New American and farm-to-table concepts, often rooted in local sourcing and community connection.
    </p>
    <p>
      What makes dining in Tulsa distinctive is its lack of pretension. Even the most refined meals feel accessible, and hospitality remains central. Food here is about sharing stories as much as plates.

    <h2>Culture: Memory, Music, and Creative Momentum</h2>
    <p>
      Tulsa’s cultural identity is deeply layered. The Greenwood District stands as both a symbol of extraordinary achievement and profound loss, and its preservation and interpretation remain central to understanding the city. History here is not abstract—it is actively remembered and discussed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Music runs just as deep. Tulsa has long been a crossroads for jazz, blues, country, and rock, producing artists who shaped American sound. Today, live music venues, small festivals, and community performances keep that legacy alive in everyday ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      Visual arts, theater, and public spaces also play a major role. From world-class museums to neighborhood galleries and murals, Tulsa’s creative life feels integrated rather than isolated.
