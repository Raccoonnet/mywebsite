    <p><p>Set among the gentle hills and winding creeks of Franklin County, Union carries the steady confidence of a true county seat. About an hour southwest of St. Louis, it feels close enough to the metro area for convenience, yet far enough to breathe a little deeper. Fields and wooded ridgelines frame the horizon, and the pace of life follows the rhythm of seasons rather than traffic lights.</p>

<p>Union’s heart beats around its historic courthouse square. Red-brick storefronts, locally owned shops, and community offices surround the stately Franklin County Courthouse, a landmark that anchors both civic life and local identity. Generations have gathered here for parades, holiday celebrations, and everyday errands, giving the square a sense of continuity that feels reassuring.</p>

<p>What makes Union special isn’t spectacle—it’s steadiness. Families build lives here, small businesses grow through relationships, and Friday nights often mean high school football or dinner with neighbors. It’s a place where growth is thoughtful, where rural roots remain visible, and where community still feels personal.</p>
