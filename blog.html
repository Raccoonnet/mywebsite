      26 Feb 2026
      <p>Indianapolis is one of those cities that quietly impresses you. It’s clean, welcoming, walkable, and full of history, food, and fun experiences. From fascinating museums to canal strolls, pedal pubs, monuments, and legendary steakhouses — Indy delivers a full day of adventure.</p>

      25 Feb 2026
      <p>There’s something special about spending a full day exploring a city from sunrise to sunset — and my day in Cleveland was packed with great beer, great food, football, shopping, live music, and a perfect Lake Erie sunset.</p>

      20 Dec 2025
      <p>If you’re a fan of beer, history, or just a good time, the Anheuser-Busch Brewery tour in St. Louis should definitely be on your list. I recently went on their Day Fresh tour, and it was an absolute blast from start to finish.</p>

      12 Oct 2025
      <p>If you’re looking for a place where the Old West still kicks up dust, the Fort Worth Stockyards is it. Located just north of downtown Fort Worth, this historic district is full of Texas charm, longhorn cattle, and some surprisingly great coffee.</p>
