    <h1>My Program Page</h1>
    <p>This will be the location of all of my programs. There will be two sections. The links to web applications and program executables.
        The webpages will be accessable by phone users, but the executables will not necessarily be phone accessable.
        As such I must recommend that phone users do not try and use the program executables.
