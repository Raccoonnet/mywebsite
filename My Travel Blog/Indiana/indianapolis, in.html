        <h2>Indiana State Museum</h2>
        <p>The Indiana State Museum is a wonderful location in downtown Indianapolis. 
          It has several interesting exhibits including state history, ice age history, Indiana pioneer 
          history, and African-American history. It is located in a string of other city attractions such 
          as the Downtown Canal Walk, White River State Park, and the Indianapolis Zoo. The really 
          interesting thing about this setup is that it allows visitors to park in a centralized 
          parking lot and walk to the attraction of their choice. I would recommend using the 
          underground parking. Parking and entry cost money.</p>

        <h2>Downtown Canal Walk</h2>
        <p>The Downtown Canal Walk is a brilliant canal that is used to connect many downtown 
          Indianapolis attractions together. Attractions such as the Indiana State Museum, coffee shops, 
          White River State Park, Military Park, and more. There are even apartments located on the canal. 
          The canal is very long which provides a great opportunity for walking and running. 
          There are also Swan Boats and kayaks available for rental. I would recommend using 
          the underground parking. Parking costs money, but the walk is free.</p>

        <h2>White River State Park</h2>
        <p>White River State Park is a state park next to the White River that runs through downtown 
          Indianapolis. It provides a wonderful open space and a place to gaze at the White River. 
          I would recommend using the underground parking. Parking costs money.</p>

        <h2>St. Elmo's Steakhouse</h2>
        <p>St. Elmo's Steakhouse is considered by most to be the best restaurant in Indiana. 
          It is also the oldest steakhouse in the state of Indiana. Located in downtown Indianapolis in what 
          I would describe as the food district. It is easily the best dining experience and food I have ever had. 
          Definitely worth the price. When I visited Indianapolis, the city was putting on an event called Devour Indy. 
          This event gave me access to a special sample menu and gave me the opportunity to try their signature dish and a 
          spectacular filet mignon. Devour Indy seems to be a yearly event that takes place in Indianapolis during the later summer months. 
          I would recommend using the underground parking. Parking costs money.</p>

        <h2>White River</h2>
        <p>The White River is a river that runs through Indianapolis. In downtown Indianapolis there 
          is a White River State Park that runs alongside it. I would recommend using the underground parking. Parking costs money.</p>

        <h2>The Hangar: Handlebar Pedal Pub Tour</h2>
        <p>The Hangar is a bar that hosts the original Handlebar Pedal Pub Tour. 
          This is a big multiple seat bicycle that allows bar patrons to drink, pedal, bar hop, and receive a tour of downtown Indianapolis. 
          No need for concern, the bike has four wheels and is operated by a sober tour guide. 
          It was a very fun experience and a truly Midwest way to learn a new city.</p>

        <h2>Soldiers & Sailors Monument</h2>
        <p>The Soldiers & Sailors Monument is a war monument in the center of downtown Indianapolis. 
          It was built to honor the soldiers and sailors from Indiana who served in the American Revolutionary War, 
          the conflicts that led to the War of 1812, the Mexican-American War, and the Spanish-American War. 
          Since its construction it has become a symbol of Indianapolis, the capital of Indiana.</p>

        <h2>USS Indianapolis National Memorial</h2>
        <p>The USS Indianapolis National Memorial is an impactful memorial dedicated to the story of the USS Indianapolis, 
          a heavy cruiser that sailed in WWII. The memorial is dedicated to all of the lost sailors who were killed via the sinking of the ship, 
          exposure to the open seas, and shark attacks. The memorial is located in the Downtown Channel Walk. I would recommend using the underground parking. 
          Parking costs money.</p>

        <h2>Downtown Indianapolis</h2>
        <p>Downtown Indianapolis is the best downtown I have ever seen from a city. It is peaceful, clean, and fairly safe. 
          Everything is close and the structure of Indianapolis's downtown is very organized, which I like a lot.</p>
