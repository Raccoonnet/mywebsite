        <h2>Indiana State Museum</h2>
        <p>The Indiana State Museum is a wonderful location in downtown Indianapolis. 
          It has several interesting exhibits including state history, ice age history, Indiana pioneer 
          history, and African-American history. It is located in a string of other city attractions such 
          as the Downtown Canal Walk, White River State Park, and the Indianapolis Zoo. The really 
          interesting thing about this setup is that it allows visitors to park in a centralized 
          parking lot and walk to the attraction of their choice. I would recommend using the 
          underground parking. Parking and entry cost money.</p>

        <h2>Downtown Canal Walk</h2>
        <p>The Downtown Canal Walk is a brilliant canal that is used to connect many downtown 
          Indianapolis attractions together. Attractions such as the Indiana State Museum, coffee shops, 
          White River State Park, Military Park, and more. There are even apartments located on the canal. 
          The canal is very long which provides a great opportunity for walking and running. 
          There are also Swan Boats and kayaks available for rental. I would recommend using 
          the underground parking. Parking costs money, but the walk is free.</p>

        <h2>White River State Park</h2>
        <p>White River State Park is a state park next to the White River that runs through downtown 
          Indianapolis. It provides a wonderful open space and a place to gaze at the White River. 
          I would recommend using the underground parking. Parking costs money.</p>

        <h2>Lincoln Tomb</h2>
        <p>The Lincoln Tomb was a timeless destination. It is definitely a must see if one ever travels to Springfield.
          The destination pays homage to one of our greatest presidents and has many statues and plagues describing his
          great work. The location is also very peaceful.</p>

        <h2>Lincoln Memorial Garden and Nature Center</h2>
        <p>The Lincoln Memorial Garden and Nature Center is a wonderful location right near Lake Springfield to take in
          some nature and enjoy the Illinois outdoors.
          They have hiking and festivals sometimes. When I went, the fall festival was open and I had a good time
          listening to live music.</p>

        <p>The Illinois State Fair is held in Springfield every year and offers many amazing activities for all ages.
          From rides to petting zoos, the Illinois State Fair has everything you could want with a state fair. I have
          been
          several times and I always have a fantastic time.</p>
