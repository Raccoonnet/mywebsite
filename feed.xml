<p>If you’re a fan of beer, history, or just a good time, the Anheuser-Busch Brewery tour in St. Louis should definitely be on your list. I recently went on their Day Fresh tour, and it was an absolute blast from start to finish.</p>

<p>One of the first highlights? The famous Anheuser-Busch Clydesdales. Getting up close to these majestic horses in their stables was incredible—there’s something about seeing these gentle giants in person that photos just can’t capture.</p>

<p>The tour itself was about an hour and a half, and it covered everything from the brewing process to the packing and bottling lines. I loved seeing how a massive operation like this works behind the scenes, and the buildings on the campus are impressive, to say the least. The guides were friendly and shared fascinating tidbits about the history of Anheuser-Busch and its founders, which made the experience feel both educational and fun.</p>

<p>Now, for the best part: the samples. I got to try several beers, but the real standout was the “St. Louis Lager”, a vintage recipe that had been lost for decades. This exclusive brew is only available seasonally, and it was amazing to taste a piece of history that’s rarely seen outside the brewery. To top it off, they even gave us a freshly bottled beer to take home at the end of the tour—what a cool touch!</p>

<p>At just $15 for the tour, it was totally worth it. I’ve been on a few brewery tours before, but this one might just be my favorite. Between the historic vibes, the incredible marketing flair (looking at you, Clydesdales), and the tasting experience, it really felt like a perfect blend of fun and education.</p>

<p>If you find yourself in St. Louis and love a good beer story, the Anheuser-Busch Brewery tour is a must-visit. Cheers!</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Fun Day at the Anheuser-Busch Brewery in St. Louis]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Fort Worth Stockyards</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/mywebsite/2025/10/12/fort_worth_stockyards.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Fort Worth Stockyards" /><published>2025-10-12T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2025-10-12T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/mywebsite/2025/10/12/fort_worth_stockyards</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/mywebsite/2025/10/12/fort_worth_stockyards.html"><![CDATA[<p>A Day in the Fort Worth Stockyards: Cowboy Hats, Cattle Drives &amp; Cold Brew with Coke</p>

<p>If you’re looking for a place where the Old West still kicks up dust, the Fort Worth Stockyards is it. Located just north of downtown Fort Worth, this historic district is full of Texas charm, longhorn cattle, and some surprisingly great coffee.</p>

<p>Morning Jitters (In the Best Way)</p>

<p>My day started with a much-needed caffeine fix at Avoca Coffee Roasters, a local favorite that quickly won me over. Their Bourbon Butterscotch Latte was smooth, sweet, and had just the right kick to get me going. But the real standout? A drink called the Charlie Sheen. Yes, you read that right. It’s a cold brew mixed with Coca-Cola—odd, refreshing, and unexpectedly addictive. It’s the kind of thing you try as a joke and then find yourself low-key craving later.</p>

<p>Hat Fitted &amp; Feeling It</p>

<p>With caffeine coursing through my veins and a bounce in my boots, I wandered into Maverick Fine Western Wear. If you’re in the market for a proper cowboy hat, this is the spot. The staff didn’t just sell me a hat—they fit me for one, making sure it matched my head shape and style. Their customer service was seriously top-notch. I walked out feeling like I could star in a Western (or at least look the part).</p>

<p>Exploring the Strip</p>

<p>The Fort Worth Strip runs through the heart of the Stockyards and is packed with quirky shops, rustic saloons, and western boutiques. It’s the kind of place where you can pick up handcrafted leather goods, snap a pic with a longhorn, and overhear stories from real-deal cowboys—all in the span of an hour.</p>

<p>Longhorns &amp; Rodeo Dreams</p>

<p>One of the coolest things about the Stockyards is the twice-daily cattle drive. Real Texas cowhands guide a herd of longhorns down Exchange Avenue, and it’s as Instagram-worthy as it sounds. I made sure to catch the afternoon drive, which felt like stepping straight into history.</p>

<p>And speaking of cowboy culture, I capped off my afternoon by seeing my first-ever rodeo at the Cowtown Coliseum. Between the bull riding, barrel racing, and electrified crowd, it was an adrenaline rush like nothing else. The energy is contagious, and even if you’ve never been to a rodeo before, you’ll find yourself cheering like you grew up on a ranch.</p>

<p>Honky Tonkin’ at Billy Bob’s Texas</p>

<p>After sunset, I headed to Billy Bob’s Texas, proudly known as the world’s largest honky tonk. It’s more than just a country bar—it’s a whole experience. Think live music, dance floors, pool tables, and even indoor bull riding. Whether you’re two-stepping with strangers or just soaking up the scene, Billy Bob’s is the perfect way to end a Fort Worth night.</p>

<p>Final Thoughts</p>

<p>The Fort Worth Stockyards isn’t just a tourist attraction—it’s a living piece of Western history. From custom cowboy hats and cold brew curiosities to cattle drives and country beats, this place has a little something for everyone. Whether you’re a city slicker or a wannabe cowboy like me, you’ll find something to love in Fort Worth.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Day in the Fort Worth Stockyards: Cowboy Hats, Cattle Drives &amp; Cold Brew with Coke]]></summary></entry></feed>
