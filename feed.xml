<p>If you’re looking for a place where the Old West still kicks up dust, the Fort Worth Stockyards is it. Located just north of downtown Fort Worth, this historic district is full of Texas charm, longhorn cattle, and some surprisingly great coffee.</p>

<p>Morning Jitters (In the Best Way)</p>

<p>My day started with a much-needed caffeine fix at Avoca Coffee Roasters, a local favorite that quickly won me over. Their Bourbon Butterscotch Latte was smooth, sweet, and had just the right kick to get me going. But the real standout? A drink called the Charlie Sheen. Yes, you read that right. It’s a cold brew mixed with Coca-Cola—odd, refreshing, and unexpectedly addictive. It’s the kind of thing you try as a joke and then find yourself low-key craving later.</p>

<p>Hat Fitted &amp; Feeling It</p>

<p>With caffeine coursing through my veins and a bounce in my boots, I wandered into Maverick Fine Western Wear. If you’re in the market for a proper cowboy hat, this is the spot. The staff didn’t just sell me a hat—they fit me for one, making sure it matched my head shape and style. Their customer service was seriously top-notch. I walked out feeling like I could star in a Western (or at least look the part).</p>

<p>Exploring the Strip</p>

<p>The Fort Worth Strip runs through the heart of the Stockyards and is packed with quirky shops, rustic saloons, and western boutiques. It’s the kind of place where you can pick up handcrafted leather goods, snap a pic with a longhorn, and overhear stories from real-deal cowboys—all in the span of an hour.</p>

<p>Longhorns &amp; Rodeo Dreams</p>

<p>One of the coolest things about the Stockyards is the twice-daily cattle drive. Real Texas cowhands guide a herd of longhorns down Exchange Avenue, and it’s as Instagram-worthy as it sounds. I made sure to catch the afternoon drive, which felt like stepping straight into history.</p>

<p>And speaking of cowboy culture, I capped off my afternoon by seeing my first-ever rodeo at the Cowtown Coliseum. Between the bull riding, barrel racing, and electrified crowd, it was an adrenaline rush like nothing else. The energy is contagious, and even if you’ve never been to a rodeo before, you’ll find yourself cheering like you grew up on a ranch.</p>

<p>Honky Tonkin’ at Billy Bob’s Texas</p>

<p>After sunset, I headed to Billy Bob’s Texas, proudly known as the world’s largest honky tonk. It’s more than just a country bar—it’s a whole experience. Think live music, dance floors, pool tables, and even indoor bull riding. Whether you’re two-stepping with strangers or just soaking up the scene, Billy Bob’s is the perfect way to end a Fort Worth night.</p>

<p>Final Thoughts</p>

<p>The Fort Worth Stockyards isn’t just a tourist attraction—it’s a living piece of Western history. From custom cowboy hats and cold brew curiosities to cattle drives and country beats, this place has a little something for everyone. Whether you’re a city slicker or a wannabe cowboy like me, you’ll find something to love in Fort Worth.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A Day in the Fort Worth Stockyards: Cowboy Hats, Cattle Drives &amp; Cold Brew with Coke]]></summary></entry></feed>
