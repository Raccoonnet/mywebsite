    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello, my name is Raccoon. I am a computer engineering student and have recently decided to create my own website.</p>
    <h2>Purpose of Site</h2>
    <p>Along with the opportunity to program my own website, I have decided to dedicate this netspace to a helpful travel blog.</p>
    <p>The purpose of this blog is to document my travels around the United States and to help other people who would like to travel as well.</p>
    <p>My current ambition is to visit all 50 states in the USA and I plan to outline my favorite stops along the way here.</p>
