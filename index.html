    <p>Hello, my name is Raccoon. I am a computer engineering student and have recently decided to create my own
        website.</p>
    <h2>Purpose of Site</h2>
    <p>Along with the opportunity to program my own website, I have decided to dedicate this netspace to a helpful
        travel blog. <br>
        The purpose of this blog is to document my travels around the United States and to help other people who would
        like to travel as well. <br>
        My current ambition is to visit all 50 states in the USA and I plan to outline my favorite stops along the way
        here.</p>
