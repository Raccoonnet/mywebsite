<p>Here’s a look at all the states I’ve had the joy of visiting so far!
Each one has been colored in on the map below, a little visual diary of my adventures across the U.S. Every state holds its own unique memories—whether it was a spontaneous road trip, a weekend getaway, or a long-anticipated vacation.

Some places surprised me with their charm, others stole my heart with their landscapes, food, or people. Together, they all tell the story of where I’ve been—and hint at where I might be headed next.

Take a look and see how the journey is unfolding—there’s still so much more to discover.</p>
